<h1>                     Known bugs in the Cyrus IMAP Server</h1>

<ul>
<li> Multiple APPENDs don't always correctly return the EXISTS response.

<li> Particularly large quotas can wrap around.

<li> The Sieve subsystem will refuse to filter two messages with
identical message-ids, even if they have different envelopes.

<li>The RENAME command does not have the hierarchical behavior
required by the IMAP4rev1 specification.  The CAPABILITY command now
returns X-NON-HIERARCHICAL-RENAME in its response in order to
advertise this bug.  We plan to have this fixed eventually.

<li>Using AFS groups with ptclient, users with negative rights as part of
groups may be granted access to mailboxes if ptclient has died.  We plan
to have this fixed eventually.

<li> 8-bit set characters are coerced to 'X', but not before the notify_zephyr 
code (if used) has had a chance to send them out.

<li> In some failures of the krbck program, the error messages printed out
bear no resemblance to what actually went wrong.

<li> Deliver does not handle messages containing NUL properly due to
stdio problems (the characters between the NUL and the LF will be
lost.)

<li> Deliver doesn't gracefully handle CR CR sequences in messages.
Well, ok, it hangs.

<li> cyradm doesn't handle BYE quite properly (especially a BYE right after
connect).

<li> Random krb4 problems (and no, we don't know why they happen):
  <ul>
  <li> It's possible to cause imtest/imapd to crash with <TT>Decoding
  error: Incorrect network address (krb_rd_req)</TT> by sending a
  large amount of information at once.  Possibly fixed?
  </ul>
</ul>

<h1>                     Things we want to do</h1>

<ul>
<li> Implement the IMAP ID extension.

<li> Implement the IMAP VIEW extension.

<li> The vacation action in Sieve shouldn't respond to messages that
have an "Auto-Submitted" category anything but "No".
</ul>

<p>
Please report bugs to <a
href="mailto:cyrus-bugs@andrew.cmu.edu">cyrus-bugs@andrew.cmu.edu</a>.
Be sure to include (at least) system type, compiler used, and the
options passed to configure, along with a detailed report.  Additional
information is welcome, and naturally, patches are deeply appreciated.

<p>
If you submit a patch, please send unified diffs (-u) if your diff program
supports them, or context diffs (-c) if it doesn't.  Plain diffs are very
difficult to evaluate.
